# Pixiv Twitter Bot [@key_images][http://twitter.com/key_images]
This is a bot that retrieves images from Pixiv and posts them to twitter.

Adapted from [CutePetsBmore][https://github.com/Ryan-J-Smith/CutePetsBmore].

## Quickstart:

### On twitter:

1. Create the twitter account that will be used to post tweets
1. Log into this new account and navigate to http://apps.twitter.com
1. Create a new app with permission to post
1. Generate credentials (consumer keys and access tokens)

### In code:

1. Configure `credentials.py` by adding the keys generated by twitter
1. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Modify `search_terms.py` to include desired search terms
    1. Currently only searches by tag for the word key, and hardcodes the pagination limit
1. Tweet a singe image: `python tweet_pic.py`

### Schedule regular tweeting with crontab (Linux):

1. From the command line, edit the crontab file: `crontab -e`
1. Schedule the script to run every hour using a line similar to: `0 * * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/tweet_pic.py >> /path/to/log.log) 2>&1`

## Notes:

### Image storage

Images are saved to the `LOCAL_IMG_PATH` by their `ID`


### Avoidance of duplicate tweets

The script `tweet_pet.py` attempts to avoid reposting tweets about the same animals.  This is done by tracking recent tweets in a buffer file created by the script.  The size of the buffer file can be adjusted by changing the value of the `NUM_RECENT_TWEETS` in `tweet_pet.py`.

### Addtional notes:

* I intended this to run on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.  The python script posts a new tweet each time it is called. Regularly scheduled posting is handled by `cron`.
